# Analysis of Brain Networks Final Project
Vanderbilt BME3890 final project (Fall 2022, Senior Year)

For this project, we were tasked with proposing a project question based 
on both topics explored in the class and our interests. We decided upon this question: In what ways do the group differences detected between autistic and non-autistic samples vary based on (1) the number of iterations of k-means clustering conducted for parcellation and (2) the threshold used to scrub the parcel-correlation matrix?

For this project, I designed and wrote the majority of the code, while my teammates Joseph and Vidhya focused on interpretation of results and presentation of findings.

I am publishing this simply as a work example. I no longer have access to the brain scans used for analysis.
