# Analysis of Brain Networks Final Project
Vanderbilt BME3890 final project (Fall 2022, Senior Year)

For this project, we were tasked with proposing a project question based 
on both topics explored in the class and our interests. We decided upon this question: In what ways do the group differences detected between autistic and non-autistic samples vary based on (1) the number of iterations of k-means clustering conducted for parcellation and (2) the threshold used to scrub the parcel-correlation matrix?

For this project, I designed and wrote the majority of the code, while my teammates Joseph and Vidhya focused on interpretation of results and presentation of findings.

I am publishing this simply as a work example. I no longer have access to the brain scans used for analysis.

I included both the original livescript (.mlx), and a normal script (.m). MATLAB (online or application) is needed to view the .mlx file. The .mlx file has figures and analysis, while the .m file only has the code (and project explanation / motivation). The NBS toolbox (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/nbs/) was used for some steps (mainly xyz to mni mapping and plotting).
